# Subtitle renamer
## The idea
I'm a university student as an Electrical Engineer and after a year of programming courses I decided that I create an application in aid of one of my problem. I like to watch movies and TV shows, but I'm tired of renaming subtitles every time I want to watch one. As this problem can be automated, this project started.
## Description
It renames your subtitles to the name of the video files (which are in the same directory), so your video player will detect them automatically.
Subtitle renamer is:
- Easy-to-use - it's only parameter is the directory
- Fast - hundreds of renames per sec
- Compact - you can choose a higher directory as all subdirectories will be checked
- Extensive - your portable hard-drive or network drive
## Usage
```sh
C:\directory-of-exe\subtitlesync.exe H:\directory-to-be-synchronized
```
## Roadmap
- Clean garbage files (.nfo and others)
- Recognize TV series episodes, even when the number of subtitles and videos doesn't match
## Features in mind
- Make the program error-safe (\w undo logging)
- GUI
## Contributing
As it's my learning project I don't want pull requests with ready-to-use codes, but I would appreciate it, if you have any web links, short codes or even refactoring ideas for this project.

So please create a pull request or open an issue if:
- the code can be improved in any way
- you found a bug
- you have a new feature idea
- you would like to help me in the rocky road of making this project into a working application
